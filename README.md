# CommonUnits draft
The International System of Units is great, but broken. When it was written, the authors let some inconsistency exist as part of the specification for convenience. Hence this repo is a mind-dump to attempt to define a new spec which builds on SI, but attempts to normalize the system. We call this `CommonUnits`. This is the opening draft. Open to PRs.

> This is a living, growing document that does not define any solid specifications right now. Instead of seeing this as a serious effort to change everyone from SI to CU, it should be taken as an interesting "what if" thought experiment. See [Preface](docs/0.Preface.MD) to understand what we think a hypothetical `CommonUnits` should do.
